Bazel Notes


================================================================
Circular deps:

example:  //src/ocf depends on //src/sec, but the latter needs ocstack.h

solution:  split modules into interface (public) and implementation (private) targets


================================================================
code reorg:

csdk/connectivity/api/casecurityinterface.h - why is this not in security?
