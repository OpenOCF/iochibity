This file contains detailed but generic information on building and
installing this project.  For shorter instructions, see README.

Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./scons.

  2. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `scons -c`.

Tools
=====

The primary build tool used by this project is Scons. The best way to
learn about scons is to read its manpage, which is available online at
http://scons.org/doc/HTML/scons-man.html.

scons has many options, documented in the man page.  Note that `scons
--help` will print the help message for this project, not for scons
itself.  To print that, use `scons -H`.

Other required tools: git, ssh, etc.

Compilers and Options
=====================

gcc

clang

llvm


Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, ...

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an


Optional Features
=================

Run `scons --help`


Specifying the System Type
==========================

   Usually scons can figure out by itself what features are available
   in the host environment, but sometimes it needs help.

   To cross-compile, use the TARGET_OS and TARGET_ARCH options.


Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `scons` scripts to share,
you can create a site script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.

"Before reading the SConstruct file, scons looks for a directory named site_scons in various system directories (see below) and the directory containing the SConstruct file; for each of those dirs which exists, site_scons is prepended to sys.path, the file site_scons/site_init.py, is evaluated if it exists, and the directory site_scons/site_tools is prepended to the default toolpath if it exists. See the --no-site-dir and --site-dir options for more details."  (scons manpage)
