=== problems

* octypes.h contains some `#ifdef __cplusplus` - why?

* enums are used for constants, like OCTpsSchemeFlags; this forces
  lots of ifdefs.  using plain defines would allow us to avoid such
  globals

* in general octypes.h is a global kitchen sink.  wouldn't it be better to partition?  for example, some of the conditionals like WITH_PRESENCE, RA_ADAPTER
