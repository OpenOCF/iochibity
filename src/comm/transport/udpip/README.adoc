=== inbound data handling

udp_data_receiver_runloop runs on a dedicated thread, put there by CAIPStartServer
=> udp_handle_inbound_data - platform-specific, on linux: select on sockets, when data arrive, call
==> udp_recvmsg_on_socket
====> if secure: CAdecryptSsl
====> else mh_CAReceivedPacketCallback

CAdecryptSsl decrypts data and invokes a callback == mh_CAReceivedPacketCallback, for UDP, CATCPPacketReceivedCB for TCP

mh_CAReceivedPacketCallback massages data and places it on g_receiveThread for later processing


Tasks:

* observe (recv) incoming data messages - select/recvmsg on all data sockets
* exhibit (send) messages
* monitor interface/addr status messages - netlink socket (CARegisterForAddressChanges) select/recvmsg


Naming fixes:
CARegisterForAddressChanges -> initialize_interface_monitor (i.e. create the netlink socket)
CAFindReadyMessage          -> wait_for_ready_interfaces
CASelectReturned            -> process_ready_interfaces
CAReceiveMessage            -> handle_data_message
CAFindInterfaceChange       -> handle_network_change_message
CAIPGetInterfaceInformation -> get_ifaddrs_info
CAProcessNewInterface       -> join_multicast_group


* list local interfaces

* respond dynamically to network/interface changes

=== callback hell

* CAReceiveMessage calls g_packetReceivedCallback
* g_packetReceivedCallback was set to CAIPPacketReceivedCB (caipadapter.c)
* CAIPPacketReceivedCB calls g_networkPacketCallback (and does nothing else)
* g_networkPacketCallback was set to ifc_CAReceivedPacketCallback
* ifc_CAReceivedPacketCallback calls g_networkPacketReceivedCallback (and does nothing else)
* g_networkPacketReceivedCallback was set to mh_CAReceivedPacketCallback

We short-circuit this and have CAReceiveMessage call mh_CAReceivedPacketCallback directly.

== interface/endpoint lists

CAInterface_t v. CAEndpoint_t

g_local_endpoints is a u_arraylist_t of CAEndpoint_* in udp_controller

g_caSslContext->peerList is in ca_adapter_net_ssl, contains SslEndPoint_t

The list created by CAIPGetInterfaceInformation is never cached in a
g_* var.  Note that the ONLY place CAIPGetInterfaceInformation is
called with a non-zero arg is in CAFindInterfaceChange

in ocendpoint.c:

typedef struct CAEndpoint_s
{
    CATransportAdapter_t    adapter;    // adapter type
    CATransportFlags_t      flags;      // transport modifiers
    uint16_t                port;       // for IP
    char                    addr[MAX_ADDR_STR_SIZE_CA]; // address for all
    uint32_t                ifindex;    // usually zero for default interface
    char                    remoteId[CA_MAX_IDENTITY_SIZE]; // device ID of remote device
#if defined (ROUTING_GATEWAY) || defined (ROUTING_EP)
    char                    routeData[MAX_ADDR_STR_SIZE_CA]; /**< GatewayId:ClientId of
                                                                    destination. **/
#endif
} CAEndpoint_t;

CATransportFlags_t: enum as bitfield, e.c. CA_SECURE, CA_MULTICAST, CA_IPV4, etc.

g_local_endpoints initialized by udp_controller::CAIPInitializeQueueHandles

freed by udp_controller::CAIPDeinitializeQueueHandles

udp_controller::udp_get_local_endpoints @was caipserver0::CAGetIPInterfaceInformation

managed by udp_controller::CAUpdateStoredIPAddressInfo, which calls
udp_controller::udp_get_local_endpoints, which calls caipnewmonitor_posix::CAIPGetInterfaceInformation(0)
the latter returns a list of CAInterfaceItem_t*
udp_get_local_endpoints turns that list into an ep list

CAUpdateStoredIPAddressInfo is ONLY called by
udp_status_change_handler, called only from
CAIPPassNetworkChangesToTransports

queried by udp_controller::CAIPIsLocalEndpoint, which is called by

cainterfacecontroller::CAIsLocalEndpoint, called ONLY for unicast msgs by

camessagehandler::CADetachSendMessage, called by

    caconnectivitymanager::CASendMessageMultiAdapter
    caconnectivitymanager::CASendRequest
    caconnectivitymanager::CASendResponse

So one reason g_local_endpoints exists is so CADetachSendMessage
can detect loopback messages.  It is consulted every time a unicast
message is sent.  Basically a cache, to save us the expense of
calling getsockname every time?

But g_local_endpoints is not always used.  udp_get_local_endpoints is
also called via the .GetNetInfo field of the udpController registered
in g_adapterHandler. In which case CAIPGetInterfaceInformation(0) is
called, resulting in a call to getifaddrs and update of "networklist"
and call to CAIPPassNetworkChangesToTransports

(occollection::BuildCollectionLinksPayloadArray | ocresource::BuildIntrospectionResponseRepresentation
 | ocresource:HandleVirtualResource | ocresourcedirectory::HandleVirtualResource)
=> caconnectivitymanager::CAGetNetworkInformation
==> canetworkconfigurator.c::CAGetNetworkInformationInternal
===> cainterfacecontroller::CAGetNetworkInfo
====> g_adapterHandler[index].GetNetInfo = udp_get_local_endpoints

== portability

SIOCGIFCONF won't return IPv6 addrs. Netlink is Linux only.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20743709/get-ipv6-addresses-in-linux-using-ioctl :
"Each platform has a different way of getting the IPv6 ones:
Linux, use NETLINK if you're crazy, use getifaddrs if you have a vaguely recent glibc, otherwise read /proc/net/if_inet6 (eg on Android).
Darwin or FreeBSD: use getifaddrs.
Solaris, use SIOCGLIFCONF.
AIX, use SIOCGIFCONF which actually returns IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (because they have an sa_len field in struct sockaddr they can actually support that).
"

Platforms:

    Posix:  shared by all? or just by Linux, BSD, Darwin, Android

    Darwin, Linux, BSD: platform-specific code, e.g. netlink stuff for linux

    Tizen

    Windows


Local network addresses: no really portable method

    BSD:  getifaddrs

    Darwin: BSD getifaddrs - see https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn1145/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10002984-CH1-SECGETTINGIPLIST[Getting a list of all IP addresses]

    Linux: getifaddrs (not quite same as BSD getifaddrs), netlink

    Android: getifaddrs introduced in 24, otherwise netlink

        android-ifaddrs: https://github.com/morristech/android-ifaddrs


   POSIX: no such API, per https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8645566/is-there-a-posix-compliant-way-of-getting-local-network-ip-address-of-my-compute.

    Windows: GetAdapterAddresses?

why getifaddrs and not netlink? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/579783/how-to-detect-ip-address-change-programmatically-in-linux

getifaddrs manpage: "Support of address families other than IPv4 is available only on kernels that support netlink."

but netlink is Linux-only

Winsock v. POSIX sockets: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28027937/cross-platform-sockets

Dynamic response to changes:

    Linux:  netlink

    BSD:  ??

    OS X:  System Configuration framework

=== network monitoring

The monitoring logic is impossibly obscure. Let's sum it up: what is
supposed to happen, in the end, when a network interface comes up or
goes down?

    1  local endpoint list is updated
    2  sockets on the interface (by index) are added to the multicast group
    3  call OCDefaultAdapterStateChangedHandler (a NOP)
                 OCDefaultConnectionStateChangedHandler
		 ==> CopyEndpointToDevAddr
		 ==> GiveStackFeedBackObserverNotInterested

Observation/monitoring flow (caipserver.c):

CAIpStartServer CAReceiveHandler to threadpool
CAReceiveHandler loop => CAFindReadyMessage => CASelectReturned
for data messages, CASelectReturned calls CAReceiveMessage
for if change messages, CASelectReturned calls CAFindInterfaceChange, CAProcessNewInterface
for shutdown messages, CASelectReturned quits

CAFindInterfaceChange -> CAIPGetInterfaceInformation
CAIPGetInterfaceInformation => getifaddrs, converts result to list of CAInterface_t


[source,]
----
OCInitializeInternal passes default handlers:
=> CARegisterNetworkMonitorHandler (comm/util/cautilinterface.c) # 1-line wrapper
==> CASetNetworkMonitorCallbacks (comm/util/cautilinterface.c) # 1-line wrapper
===> AddNetworkStateChangedCallback (cainterfacecontroller.c)
             which appends the handlers/callbacks to g_networkChangeCallbackList
----

handlers passed by ocstack/OCInitializeInternal/CARegisterNetworkMonitorHandler:
OCDefaultAdapterStateChangedHandler (ocstack.c) - sends presence notification
OCDefaultConnectionStateChangedHandler (ocstack.c) - connection-oriented transports only?

NOTE: CARegisterNetworkMonitorHandler only called once, so the default
handlers are used by all transports

In the end, these default handlers are called by cainterfacecontroller::CAAdapterChangedCallback, which is called directly by udp_status_manager::udp_if_change_handler



AddNetworkStateChangedCallback adds the CB to global handlers list:
g_networkChangeCallbackList (cainterfacecontroller.c)

g_networkChangeCallbackList items are used in
CAAdapterChangedCallback, which is called from
udp_status_change_handler (was CAIPAdapterHandler)
which is called from CAIPPassNetworkChangesToTransports

(What counts as "adapter" state change? Adapter means transport)

CAInitializeAdapters (cainterfacecontroller.c), passing CBs to:
=> CAInitializeIP (caipadapter0.c)
        CARegisterCallback (cainterfacecontroller.c)
	    (will be passed ipHandler struct of CBs, uses it to initialize g_adapterHandler)
	CAReceivedPacketCallback (cainterfacecontroller.c)
	CAAdapterChangedCallback (cainterfacecontroller.c)
	CAAdapterErrorHandleCallback (cainterfacecontroller.c)

obsolete:
CAStartIP passes CAIPAdapterHandler to
CAIPStartNetworkMonitor (caipnwmonitor_<platform>.c)
=> CAIPInitializeNetworkMonitorList (caipnwmonitor0.c)
=> CAIPSetNetworkMonitorCallback (caipnwmonitor0.c) arg: CAIPAdapterStateChangeCallback

Monitoring for network changes is conflated with listening for inbound data messages:

[source,]
----
CAIpStartServer (caipserver.c/) # adds CAReceiveHandler to threadpool
=> cCAReceiveHandler (caipserver.c) # while (!caglobals.ip.terminate) { CAFindReadyMessage(); }
==> CAFindReadyMessage (caipserver_<platform>.c) #
===> CASelectReturned (caipserver_<platform>.c) # loops, recving msgs
        for netlinkFd events, we know sth has changed, so:
            => CAFindInterfaceChange  // use netlink to get RTM_DELADDR, RTM_NEWADDR
                foreach RTM_NEWADDR: we have its index, so:
		    => caipnwmonitor.c/CAIPGetInterfaceInformation(idx) (complicated, see below)
	foreach found interface call caipserver/CAProcessNewInterface to add it to multicast group
----

how is this related to the network monitor callbacks? CAAdapterChangedCallback, etc.

CASelectReturned: if caglobals.ip.netlinkFd is set then:
==> get list of IFs (CAInterfact_t) underlying all RTM_NEWADDRs (CAFindInterfaceChange)
==> CAProcessNewInterface for each

CAFindInterfaceChange (platform-dependent) called by CASelectReturned on caglobals.ip.netlinkFd
rename: udp_if_change_handler_<platform>
linux: returns iflist, u_arraylist_t of CAInterface_t (name, index, flags, family, addr)
=> recvmsg(caglobals.ip.netlinkFd...)
case RTM_DELADDR: if in CACmpNetworkList, then
==> CARemoveNetworkMonitorList(ifiIndex);
==> CAIPPassNetworkChangesToAdapter(CA_INTERFACE_DOWN);
        rename: udp_if_change_handler
case RTM_NEWADDR:
==> CAIPGetInterfaceInformation(ifaddrmsg->ifa_index)
==> 
default: continue

return: iflist containing only RTM_NEWADDR records

CAIPGetInterfaceInformation called by CAFindInterfaceChange for
RTM_NEWADDR items arg is index of interface. 0 means all interfaces.
rename: udp_get_ifs_for_rtm_newaddr

this is a complex routine, with
side-effects. Result is iflist of CAInterface_t items, one per added
interface. Method is to iterate over all addresses (getifaddrs) to
extract list of unique interfaces.

    0  create iflist for CAInterface_t items CAInterface_t (name, index, flags, family, addr)
    1  get all addresses (getifaddrs)
    2  iterate over addrs:
        ignore loopback, anything not IPv4 or IPv6
	convert ifname to index of interface (if_nametoindex), e.g. en1 to 4
	search iflist for CAInterface_t item with matching index
	   if found, continue (this interface has already been encountered
	   	   otherwise:
		       create the CAInterface_t item for the interface of the address (convert addr to string)
		       add the CAInterface_t item to iflist
		       check to see if item's index matches any entry in g_netInterfaceList
		            => CACmpNetworkList(ifitem->index);
			    if not found, then add item to g_netInterfaceList

			        created a new CAInterface_t (CANewInterfaceItem)
				CAAddNetworkMonitorList
				CAIPPassNetworkChangesToAdapter  (rename: udp_if_change_handler)

    3 finally, return iflist (list of CAInterface_t items, one per new interface)

CAProcessNewInterface called by CASelectReturned once per RTM_NEWADDR interface
rename to udp_add_if_to_multicast_groups
==> applyMulticastToInterface6 or applyMulticastToInterface4

CAIPPassNetworkChangesToAdapter(s)  (rename: udp_if_change_handler)
it iterates over g_adapterCallbackList, invoking item->callback on each
i.e. this calls the nw change handler for each transport
For UPD, the g_adapterCallbackList item is CAIPAdapterHandler, set by CAStartIP calling CAIPStartNetworkMonitor, calling CAIPSetNetworkMonitorCallback, which adds it to g_adapterCallbackList
this will eventually call OCDefaultAdapterStateChangedHandler with the transport and status?

CAIPAdapterHandler:
rename: udp_status_change_handler, integrate into udp_if_change_handler (was CAIPPassNetworkChangesToAdapter)
==> CAUpdateStoredIPAddressInfo (g_ownIpEndpointList)
            rename: udp_update_local_endpoint_cache(status)
==> g_networkChangeCallback(adapter, status) => CAAdapterChangedCallback
==> if status down and WITH_DTLS: CAcloseSslConnectionAll(CA_ADAPTER_IP);

In OpenOCF we collapse CAIPPassNetworkChangesToAdapter and CAIPAdapterHandler into udp_if_change_handler

g_networkChangeCallback: only one, set by CAInitializeIP, which passes CAAdapterChangedCallback

CAAdapterChangedCallback: adds g_networkChangeCallbackList items to g_networkChangeCallbackThread
==> create CANetworkCallbackThreadInfo_t item holding:
            OCDefaultAdapterStateChangedHandler, CA_ADAPTER_IP, UP status
==> add CANetworkCallbackThreadInfo_t item to g_networkChangeCallbackThread (CAQueueingThreadAddData)

CAUpdateStoredIPAddressInfo called by CAIPAdapterHandler
rename: udp_update_local_ep_cache
case status UP:
==> CAGetIPInterfaceInformation, which gets endpoint list from iflist (list of changed interfaces)
==> adds eps to g_ownIpEndpointList
case status DOWN: clear g_ownIpEndpointList

udp_update_local_endpoint_cache: @was CAUpdateStoredIPAddressInfo
==> udp_get_local_endpoints @was CAGetIPInterfaceInformation
====> CAIPGetInterfaceInformation(0) - returns live list of ALL unique CAInterface_t or IFs, not addresses

ocstack:
OCInitializeInternal
==> CARegisterNetworkMonitorHandler
====> CASetNetworkMonitorCallbacks(CAAdapterStateChangedCB, CAConnectionStateChangedCB)
======> AddNetworkStateChangedCallback - adds to g_networkChangeCallbackList

g_networkChangeCallbackList items are put on
g_networkChangeCallbackThread by CAAdapterChangedCallback,
CAConnectionChangedCallback

OCDefaultAdapterStateChangedHandler (ocstack)
    previously:if WITH_PRESENSE, then SendPresenceNotification
    currently: NOP

This is crazy.  g_adapterCallbackList, g_networkChangeCallback, g_networkChangeCallbackList

We have g_networkChangeCallback, set by CAInitializeIP to CAAdapterChangedCallback
which iterates over g_networkChangeCallbackList, set by InitializeInternal (etc) to
         OCDefaultAdapterStateChangedHandler, OCDefaultConnectionStateChangedHandler


=== servers

We have:

Services are organized in a struct which is initialized in `caipadapter0.c::CAInitializeIP`:

NOTE: CAStartIPDiscoveryServer and CAStartIPListeningServer are otiose

CAIPStartListenServer (which should be renamed to e.g. CAStartIPDiscoveryListener) directly.

CAReceiveHandler == callback that loops calling CAFindReadyMessage


 ipHandler.startAdapter from
 (called by caipadapter.c/CAStartIP()
caipserver.c/CAIPStartServer

== network monitor

caipnwmonitor is misnamed. it's really an IP interface manager. This
involves two tasks:

* construct a global list of ifs
* respond dynamically to changes in if status (up/down)

Terminology problems: "interface" & "address", "adapter". One nw
interface may have multiple addresses. Interface =? adapter?

caipnwmonitor.h/CAInterface_t: name, index, flags, family, addr
(string). The comments say this is misnamed since one if could have
multiple addresses. E.g. interface "en1" could have IPv4 and IPv6
addresses. Name/index pairs are unique - one per interface. The
relation between IP interface (name/index) and ifaddrs is one to many.

CAInterface_t is an IP level abstraction. It does not know about transport (UDP/TCP).

ocendpoint.c:
typedef struct CAEndpoint_s
{
    CATransportAdapter_t    adapter;    // adapter type
    CATransportFlags_t      flags;      // transport modifiers
    uint16_t                port;       // for IP
    char                    addr[MAX_ADDR_STR_SIZE_CA]; // address for all
    uint32_t                ifindex;    // usually zero for default interface
    char                    remoteId[CA_MAX_IDENTITY_SIZE]; // device ID of remote device
#if defined (ROUTING_GATEWAY) || defined (ROUTING_EP)
    char                    routeData[MAX_ADDR_STR_SIZE_CA]; /**< GatewayId:ClientId of
                                                                    destination. **/
#endif
} CAEndpoint_t

Also CASecureEndpoint_t

udp_get_local_endpoints calls CAIPGetInterfaceInformation(0) to
get a list of CAInterface_t items, then creates Endpoint list.  The
iflist is destroyed.

CAIPGetInterfaceInformation(ifindex), where 0 means all: calls
getifaddrs, then iterates over the ifaddrs till it finds the desired
index.


CASelectReturn calls CAFindInterfaceChange, then for each IF calls
CAProcessNewInterface which adds IFs to multicast groups

CAFindInterfaceChange: for deletions, calls CARemoveFromAddressList(ifiIndex) and CAIPPassNetworkChangesToTransports(CA_INTERFACE_DOWN)

for additions: iflist = CAIPGetInterfaceInformation(ifiIndex) which calls getifaddrs etc and ends up calling CANewInterfaceItem, CAAddToNetworkAddressList, and CAIPPassNetworkChangesToTransports. the latter calls udp_status_change_handler(CA_ADAPTER_IP, status), then CALogAdapterStateInfo(CA_ADAPTER_IP, status);

udp_status_change_handler calls CAUpdateStoredIPAddressInfo then CAAdapterChangedCallback

CAUpdateStoredIPAddressInfo calls udp_get_local_endpoints if IF_UP, maintains g_local_endpoints

udp_get_local_endpoints calls CAIPGetInterfaceInformation(0), then creates eps

so an addition ends up causing a reload of everything (CAIPGetInterfaceInformation(0))

CAAdapterChangedCallback calls CADefault...


Related data structs:

cacommon.h/CAEndpoint_t - transport adapter and flags, port, addr
(string), ifindex, remoteid cacommon.h/CATransportAdapter_t - enum,
CA_ADAPTER_IP (meaning UDP?), CA_ADAPTER_TCP, etc.
cacommon.h/CATransportFlags_t - enum, secure, multicast, scope, ip
version

Network IP if manager API:
caipnwmonitor.c/g_netInterfaceList  = list of CAInterface_t (u_array_list_t*)
CAIPInitializeNetworkMonitorList    = create_global_iflist
CAIPDestroyNetworkMonitorList       = destroy_global_iflist
CAAddNetworkMonitorList             = add_if_to_global_iflist (CAInterface_t)
CARemoveNetworkMonitorList          = remove_if_from_global_iflist
CACmpNetworkList(uint32_t ifiindex) = if_is_on_global_iflist (bool)

NB: as far as I can tell, g_netInterfaceList is not actually used for
anything. Clients always use the list of CAInterface_t dynamically
created and returned by CAIPGetInterfaceInformation.

The global if list is populated by CAIPGetInterfaceInformation.

At startup, CAIPStartListenServer calls
CAIPGetInterfaceInformation(0), which calls getifaddrs and then
iterates over all ifaddrs:

* converts each discovered ifaddrs to CAInterface_t and passes it to CAAddNetworkMonitorList
* makes a copy of that CAInterface_t and adds it to a list of CAInterface_t (u_arraylist_t*)
* returns the u_arraylist_t*

When if status changes, CAIPGetInterfaceInformation is called with the
index of the changed if.  E.g. CAFindInterfaceChange queries the
netlink socket to get the indices of changed interfaces. It then calls
CAIPGetInterfaceInformation, passing the index of the changed if,
which calls CAAddNetworkMonitorList (for RTM_NEWADDR) or
CARemoveNetworkMonitorList (for RTMM_DELADDR).

The netlink socket is set up in CARegisterForAddressChanges <= CAIPStartServer <= ... <= OCInit

CAIPGetInterfaceInformation(0) (i.e. get all ifs) is called by:

Note the redundancy. We call CAIPGetInterfaceInformation multiple times at startup
(OCInitializeInternal), whenever a multicast msg is sent, and when


On all platforms we have a set of 8 comm sockets (ipv4/ipv6,
unicast/multicast, secure/insecure).

We also have two "meta" sockets, one for ipaddr change event
detection, one to signal shutdown to threads. These are
platform-specific:

    ip addr changes:

       Linux uses netlink socket
       OS X - sys config framework?

       BSD - ioctl(SIOCGIFCONF)?
       Windows uses WSAEVENT

    shutdown event signaling:

        Linux, BSD, Darwin - pipe
	Windows uses WSAEVENT

caglobals.ip.shutdownFds -> shutdownPipe
shutdownFds[0] ->  shutdownPipe[READPORT]
shutdownFds[1] ->  shutdownPipe[WRITEPORT]

one header caipnwmonitor.h, platform-specific implementations

caipnwmonitor.h/CAIPCBData_t holds CATransportAdapter_t * and CAIPAdapterStateChangeCallback *


caipadapter.c/CAStartIP
=> caipnwmonitor.c/CAIPStartNetworkMonitor(cb, adapter)
===> caipnwmonitor.c/CAIPInitializeNetworkMonitorList() - creates mutex, global if list
===> CAIPSetNetworkMonitorCallback(cb, adapter)
       creates CAIPCBData_t* for cb/adapter, adds to g_adapterCallbackList

caipserver.c/CAIpStartServer // adds CAReceiveHandler to threadpool

caipserver./cCAReceiveHandler  // while (!caglobals.ip.terminate) { CAFindReadyMessage(); }

caipserver.c/CAFindReadyMessage // calls select on the set of global fds, CASelectReturned on ready fds

caipserver.c/CASelectReturned // loops, recving msgs, until all recvd or caglobals.ip.terminate
        for netlinkFd events, we know sth has changed, so:
            => CAFindInterfaceChange  // use netlink to get RTM_DELADDR, RTM_NEWADDR
                foreach RTM_NEWADDR: we have its index, so:
		    => caipnwmonitor.c/CAIPGetInterfaceInformation(idx) (complicated, see below)
	foreach found interface call caipserver/CAProcessNewInterface to add it to multicast group

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
caipnwmonitor.c/CAIPGetInterfaceInformation for a desired index

input arg is 0, or if index obtained from netlink RTM_NEWADDR if called from CAFindInterfaceChange

Called by two kinds of routines

    * those that need to process all ifs, e.g. CAIPStartListenServer adds them all to multicast group.

    * those that need only on if. e.g. called by nwmonitor on
 detection of nw changes, for the side effect of adding newly found
 ifs to nw monitoring list (and ignoring the returnd iflist). iow this
 is a very badly designed routine.

Hidden semantics: passing 0 as desired index means return all ifs,
otherwise just the one.

what does "interface information" mean, exactly?

create an u_arraylist_t * iflist to hold ifs

    call getifaddrs to get ifaddrs *ifp  (NB: each if has an (one?) address and an (one?) index)

    iterate over if addresses to find matching index:

    once we find the if by index, OR if desired index is 0:

        iterate over the iflist to see if if already added, matching index and family

	  one if has one name/index, but may have multiple addrs. we only store one CAInterfaceItem per name/index, apparently. seems a bug.

	if not: create a CAInterface_t for it, add to iflist
	if not already on the NetworkList, then
	    caipnwmonitor/CANewInterfaceItem
	        this creates a new  CAInterface_t* from the one we just made, why? because iflist owns that one
	    CAAddNetworkMonitorList, CAIPPassNetworkChangesToAdapter

CAIPPassNetworkChangesToAdapter takes one arg, if_up or down; how does
it know which adapter? it doesn't, it iterates over all adapter cbs
and passes the status (IF_UP/IF_DOWN) to each. bug?
