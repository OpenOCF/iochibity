According the the SConscript this dir is only for cloud/tcp or android or tizen

changes:

    cautilinterface.h - moved here from connectivity/api. this seems
    to be a dumping ground for various APIs, to make them available to
    client code

    commdefs.h - new file, cb prototypes moved from cautilinterface.h, to fix circularity;
        /comm/cainterfacecontroller.h includes it rather than cautilinterface.h

    cloud - all the camanager stuff (except bt_le_manager) renamed, since it only applies to cloud

    ble_manager - was camanager/bt_le_manager.  why is this here instead of in comm/transport/ble/android?

Android only:

    cabtpairinginterface.h


Mostly Android:

cautilinterface.c

cautilinterface.h:

generic routines:

    CARegisterNetworkMonitorHandler -> comm/cainterfacecontroller.c/AddNetworkStateChangedCallback
        called by ocf/ocstack.c, ocf/occonnectionmanager.c
    CAUnregisterNetworkMonitorHandler -> comm/cainterfacecontroller.c/RemoveNetworkStateChangedCallback
        called by ocf/ocstack.c, ocf/occonnectionmanager.c

    CAResult_t CAGetIpv6AddrScope(const char *addr, CATransportFlags_t *scopeLevel);

    void CAUtilSetLogLevel(CAUtilLogLevel_t level, bool hidePrivateLogEntries);

ca connection manager routines, called by ocf/occonnectionmanager.c
    only for TCP_ADAPTER && WITH_CLOUD
    i.e. this is a CM interface, why glommed into cautilinterface?
    CAUtilCMInitailize - called by ocf/occonnectionmanager.c/OCCMInitialize, which is called by
     ocstack.c as part of OCInitializeInternal, #if defined(TCP_ADAPTER) && defined(WITH_CLOUD)

    CAUtilCMTerminate - ditto, ocf/occonnectionmanger.[ch], from ocstack.c/OCCMTerminate,
         from OCDeInitializeInternal, #if defined(TCP_ADAPTER) && defined(WITH_CLOUD)

    CAUtilCMUpdateRemoteDeviceInfo
    CAUtilCMResetRemoteDeviceInfo
    CAUtilCMSetConnectionUserConfig
    CAUtilCMGetConnectionUserConfig

cxx stuff: these seem to be here just to support the cxx api

    CASetPortNumberToAssign - sets port based on adapter type, only called from resource/src/CAManager.cpp
    CAGetAssignedPortNumber - ditto

android only: these are exposed to Android via jni

    SetAutoConnectionDeviceInfo - jni
        iotivity-android:  org.iotivity.ca.CaInterface.java
		public synchronized static void setAutoConnectionDevice(String address)
	        private static native void caManagerSetAutoConnectionDeviceInfo(String address);
        	implementation java/jni/JniCaInterface.c calls SetAutoConnectionDeviceInfo
		also called by connectivity/test/ca_api_unittest.cpp
		JniCaInterface.h = org_iotivity_ca_CaInterface.h, from iotivity-android
		SetAutoConnectionDeviceInfo calls
		    comm/util/camanager/{android,tizen}/caleconnectionmanager.c/CASetLEClientAutoConnectionDeviceInfo

    CAUnsetAutoConnectionDeviceInfo - like SetAutoConnectionDeviceInfo
        calls comm/util/camanager/bt_le_manager/{android, tizen}/caleconnectionmanager.c
	    (but: #ifdeffed to Android only)
	    CAUnsetLEClientAutoConnectionDeviceInfo, which calls into JNI:
	        android.bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter/checkBluetoothAddress
		etc.

    CAResult_t CAUtilClientInitialize(JNIEnv *env, JavaVM *jvm, jobject context);
        logic depends on ADAPTER type - initializes LE client or BT pairing for EDR

android && LE_ADAPTER only:

    CAUtilClientTerminate (ANDROID && LE_ADAPTER)
    CAResult_t CAUtilSetLEScanInterval(jint intervalTime, jint workingCount)
    CAResult_t CAUtilStopLEScan()
    CAResult_t CAUtilStartLEAdvertising()  (also Tizen)
    CAResult_t CAUtilStopLEAdvertising()
    CAResult_t CAUtilSetBTConfigure(CAUtilConfig_t config)


java only:

    EDR_ADAPTER only:

        CAResult_t CAUtilClientInitialize(JNIEnv *env, JavaVM *jvm) - EDR only
	CAResult_t CAUtilStartScan(JNIEnv *env)
	CAResult_t CAUtilStopScan(JNIEnv *env)
	CAResult_t CAUtilCreateBond(JNIEnv *env, jobject device)
	void CAUtilSetFoundDeviceListener(jobject listener)
