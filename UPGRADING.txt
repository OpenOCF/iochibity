Upgrading from Iotivity

File mapping:  see upgrade.sh

Procedure:

1. Pull the latest into your Iotivity repo. Run git log and note the
most recent commit.

2. In your OpenOCF repo, make sure there are no outstanding
changes. Create a branch named by the Iotivity commit we're
merging. E.g. if the most recent commit is ABCD1234, create branch
iotivity-abcd1234.

3. Create a temp directory, e.g. /tmp/ocf/abcd1234. Edit upgrade.sh to
point to your iotivity repo, then run it from the temp directory. This
will copy all of the OpenOCF-relevant files from the Iotivity repo to
the temp dir.

4. Use a merge tool to merge the files in the temp dir against the
openocf/src dir.  E.g. on OS X: assuming your OpenOCF repo is in
$HOME/openocf, from the temp dir created in step 3 run

    $ opendiff src/ ~/openocf/src

Save merge files in another temp dir, e.g. /tmp/ocf/merge/abcd1234.

Then copy the merge tree to your openocf repo. Changed files will
overlay current files and all you need to do is check them in.

================================================================
Special Cases

A number of files must be merged by hand.  This includes

* src/ocf/presence.c and related

* resource/c_common/platform_features.h renamed to src/system.h - must by checked by hand

* src/iotivity_constants.h - OCF-specific constants (e.g. "/oic/res"),
  pulled out of octypes.h, ocstackconfig.h. Includes IOTIVITY_VERSION.

* src/transport_types.h - drawn
  from //src/comm/api/cacommon.h, //src/ocf/octypes.h, //src/comm/api/cacommon.h,
  //src/ocf/ocobserve.h
