Experimenting with bazel build of iotivity 1.3.0

WARNING:  The source tree has been reorganized substantially:

* csdk -> //src

* security -> //src/sec

* security/provisioning -> //src/provisioning

* etc.

* src and include subdirs have been removed - source and header files
  go in same director (bazel treats header files as source; this makes
  good sense imho)

* etc.

Building:

`$ bazel build <target>` where targets are defined by BUILD files.  Examples:

* `$ bazel build src/provisioning`
* `$ bazel build src/comm`
* etc

Test app:

[source,shell]
----
$ bazel build examples-bazel/OCSample:server
$ bazel build examples-bazel/OCSample:client
----

Output executables will be in `./bazel-bin/examples-bazel/OCSample`

Tested on OS X.  Server runs, but there's still a problem with the client example code.

Had it mostly building on Windows, but that will require some additional work.

Not yet tested on Linux, but should work.
