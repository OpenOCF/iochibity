TODO:

rename PropertyMap to indicate is is specific to message payloads (and thus belongs in  openocf.signals)

Note: the properties are properties of a resource but they are in a message so we don't want to confuse them with the properties of a resource on the server.

Or: move to openocf.utils.PropertyMap - doesn't matter where the props came from.

or openocf.data.PropertyMap?
