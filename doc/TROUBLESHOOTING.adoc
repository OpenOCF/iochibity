== build problems

If you get "error: use of undeclared identifier" it's probably a makeheaders problem.

1. Run ./bin/mkhdrs.sh again, with the correct --config parameter.
2. Check your C files and make sure they start with the correct
#include. If you create a new C file by copying an existing C file,
don't forget to edit the #include!
3. For #defines, structs, etc. you may need to add #if INTERFACE etc.
4. Remove "static" from functions access across compilation units
