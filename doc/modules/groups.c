/*
  oicgroup.c:  legacy code from oic 1?  or not yet specified?

  first appears, with demo code, in oic 0.9.0

  resource/examples/groupclient.cpp, groupserver.cpp

  looks obsolete, based on groupserver.cpp:

  string resourceURI = "/core/a/collection";
  string resourceTypeName = "a.collection";

  replaced by link collections, batch interface?
