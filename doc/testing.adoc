=== googletest

Iotivity uses https://github.com/google/googletest[Google Test].

`$ git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git`


==== os x

Use CMake, following the instructions in the googletest
https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/README.md[README].

Running `$ make install` will install the gtest libs to
`/usr/local/lib`, and the headers to `/usr/local/include/gtest`.

NOTE: Those instructions seem to be slightly out of date; they say
that a `.xcodeproject` file will be generated, which does not seem to
be the case.  But that's ok, we do not need it.

==== edison

It looks like edison comes with libgtest shared libs preinstalled.
Unfortunately Scons Checklib fails on them, something involving pthread syms.

A workaround: clone, build (using CMake), and install googletest, and
move the preinstalled libgtest*so files from /usr/lib to /usr/lib/gtest.
