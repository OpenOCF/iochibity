= iotivity networking

Some of the names used in the Iotivity stack are very misleading.
This is an attempt to straighten things out.

CT_ADAPTER_foo, OC_ADAPTER_foo: really means TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL, not ADAPTER

* CT_ADAPTER_x : what this really means is CT_TRANSPORT_x.
** CT_ADAPTER_IP : means UDP transport
** CT_ADAPTER_GATT_BTLE : GATT is a profile; the transport is ATT (Attribute Protocol)
** CT_ADAPTER_RFCOMM_BTEDR : RFCOMM is a transport protocol (http://www.amd.e-technik.uni-rostock.de/ma/gol/lectures/wirlec/bluetooth_info/rfcomm.html#RFCOMM Overview/Service_
** CT_ADAPTER_TCP : obviously TCP is a transport protocol
** CT_ADAPTER_NFC : not sure, assuming this really refers to a transport protocol, at least roughly

NOTE: this flags from OCConnectivityType are mirrored by OC_ consts from OCTransportAdapter

Then we have OC_IP_USE_V4 and OC_IP_USE_V6 (and their CT_
counterparts).  These are obviously about the network protocol layer:

* xx_IP_USE_Vn => xx_NETWORK_PROTOCOL_IPVn

In general, the networking protocol is implied by the transport
protocol; in the specific case of UDP and TCP, the implied networking
protocol is IP, but since there are two versions of IP we need to say
which.

    // NOTE: OCDoResource needs a DevAddr and a ConnectivityType,
    // giving redundant networking params.  Why? Maybe so
    // ConnectivityType can be used when DevAddr is NULL (multicast)?

    // // OCDevAddr
    // native public DeviceAddress   coAddress(); // ??

    // public  DeviceAddress          getCoAddress() {
    // 	if (_destination == null) {
    // 	    return coAddress();
    // 	} else {
    // 	    return _destination;
    // 	}
    // }

    // OCDoResources takes an OCConnectivityType arg, in addition to
    // the OCDevAddr arg which contains the same type of data as
    // OCConnectivityType.

    // Why is this? Maybe: if the OCDevAddr* arg is NULL, it's a multicast,
    // and can use the OCConnectivityType params.  Otherwise, it's a
    // unicast targeting the OCDevAddr, whose parameters should be
    // used.

    // If that's right, these should pull data from the device address
    // if we have one, otherwise from connectivityType

    // also OCClientResponse contains an OCConnectivityType member.
