= c without headers using makeheaders

== problems

1. Sometimes you need a #define to preceed a header, in order to
select some feature. For example, _POSIX_C_SOURCE before including
standard headers.

The problem is that makeheaders has no way of knowing that the header
depends on the define.

Unfortunately this won't work:

#if EXPORT_INTERFACE
#ifndef FOO
#define FOO 1
#endif
#include <bar.h>
#endif

That would insert the bar.h include at the top of the header, but not
the define - it would end up at the bottom of the header. Dunno why.

The rule seems to be: a #define within a #IF INTERFACE clause only
applies to the C file, not the generated header.
